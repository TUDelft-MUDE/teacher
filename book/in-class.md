# In-Class Instructions

## Before the session
- We try to meet at Friday to discuss next week's material
- Keys: best if one person gets them. Avoid going to Service Desk between 10:25-10:35, as it is easy to lose track of the key if the room was occupied before and it is being walked back by the teacher. Pick up spare power cables while at Service Desk. 

Files/Materials:

- Make sure you have found the assignments in the [workbook](https://mude-2025.github.io/workbook-2025/). If you want access to the course files, visit [the MUDE 2025 assignments organization on GitHub](https://github.com/MUDE-2025).
- Make sure you have access to the classroom files on [teams](https://tud365.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/MUDE/Gedeelde%20documenten/General/2025-2026%20Classroom%20material?csf=1&web=1&e=CR1Le0). You must be added manually to the MUDE MS Teams team
- Bring a power cable if your laptop battery does not last long (especially on Friday)
- Pick up spare power cables for students to use in class (get them at Service Desk, along with keys)

Discussion Channel: check access to in-class discussion, which will be a chat in Teams. You must be added manually. Naming convention is `2024-week-<Q>-<W>` (for example, `2024-week-1-1`).

## During the session

**We always put a pptx slide up on the screen with instructions**

Find file `in_class_instructions_<XXX>.pptx` (where `<XXX>` is `WED` or `FRI`). It should be in a place like this in the [MUDE Teams Team](https://tud365.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/MUDE/Gedeelde%20documenten/General/2025-2026%20Classroom%20material?csf=1&web=1&e=CR1Le0), for Week 1.1: `General\2025-2026 Classroom materials\Week_1_1\in_class_instructions_WED.pptx`
`

**It is critical to open the file directly so updates are visible in all rooms. Don’t copy the file.**

- If you **use the in-class computer** (recommended!) you will have to log in (use [this link to the sharepoint to find it](https://tud365.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/MUDE/Gedeelde%20documenten/General/2025-2026%20Classroom%20material?csf=1&web=1&e=CR1Le0). **Keep these tips in mind:**
  - when logging in to your TU Delft account use **NETID** in the email address, not your actual email, for example: `NETID@tudelft.nl`
  - you will need to use your 2FA tool; if you have trouble with this find another teacher to log in
  - it takes a few extra minutes to log in, so do this as soon as you get to the room
- You can use your laptop to show the slides as long as you are able to keep them visible on the projector screen. Make sure teams notifications are silenced (or at least that the message text is hidden)
- Slide transitions:
  - If there is more than one slide, set up the presentation to transition automatically (after ~5 seconds) and loop back to beginning after the last slide. See below
  - If there is only one slide, disable the transitions.
  - Note that transitions behave differently when using the browser-based Powerpoint app versus the desktop-based Powerpoint app. When in doubt, change settings in the desktop-based app.

::::::{admonition} How to Make Powerpoint Slides Loop
The online Powerpoint app (browser-based app) works differently than the desktop-based app; however, it is generally easier to get the slides online using the browser-based app:

How to set ppt slides to cycle automatically (desktop-based app):
1.	On “Transitions > Timing” set “Advance Slide” to ~5 sec and click “Apply to All”
2.	On “Slide Show > Set up” select “Set Up Slide Show” and check box “Loop continuously until Exc”

**Be mindful of what is on the projector screen and visible to students.** This means:
- Don't let students see our Teams page, as there may be sensitive information.
- Check the screen to make sure the computer or projector hasn't gone into sleep mode.
- Make announcements if an important change is made to the slide (no need to disturb students constantly, but if a deadline or assignment scope is changed, this should be announced with plenty of time for students to take it into account before the end of the session).

Some things to keep in mind:

- Note that students are assigned a room based on their group, which is posted to Brightspace.
- If using our laptop make sure your Teams notifications are not displaying the text of messages to all students!!!
- Monitor Teams Channel: ask questions, post solutions, keep each other up to date, etc. The goal is to make sure that the experience and information is as similar as possible in all rooms (e.g., tell teachers if you are giving a lot of hints/solutions, so that all students get similar help)

Behavior: what should you do in class?

- Introduce yourself and the other teachers in the room at the beginning of class; mention your “skills” that are written on your name tag. Write your names and skills on the chalkboard.
- Try to avoid giving students answers directly, unless they seem stressed or have been struggling. It is good to ask about what they have already done if they have an issue (especially for programming but also for theory content)
- If a change has been made on the pptx, announce it to the entire class, do not rely on students noticing subtle changes on the slides

**Very important**: Have fun!

## After the session

- _We book 3.69 to decompress, eat lunch, chat about how the session went and plan for the coming days._
- If you can’t make it please make sure you have communicated any feedback in the feedback document, or via the Teams channel (typos, general suggestions for improvement, observations about what happened in class)
