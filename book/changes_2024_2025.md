# Changes September 2025

From the academic year 2024-2025 to 2025-2026 the following changes have been made:
- Source files for assignments, websites and tools have been moved from [GitLab](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mude/book) to GitHub ([assignments 2025](https://github.com/mude-2025), [everything else](https://github.com/TUDelft-MUDE)) to allow open reuse.
- Each assignment has [its own private repo](https://github.com/orgs/MUDE-2025/repositories) which is linked directly to GitHub classroom to prevent manual copies.
- Assignment files are [automatically converted](formatting_assignments) to a assignment and solution version in a github workflow to prevent manual copies
- Assignments are shared in a [workbook](https://github.com/TUDelft-MUDE/workbook-2025) of which source files are shared after grading for consistency
- The landing page is converted to a [jupyterbook](https://github.com/TUDelft-MUDE/TUDelft-MUDE.github.io) for ease of editing
- Course information is shared on Brightspace to align with other courses
- New websites are hosted from a github pages server with custom domain mude.citg.tudelft.nl to ease hosting
- The old websites are moved to archive.mude.citg.tudelft.nl to maintain SSO logins where needed.
- The [textbook](https://github.com/TUDelft-MUDE/book) now makes uses of the TeachBooks-deploy-book workflow to build all branches of the book online without login required to view those versions.
- Big and binary files are moved to a [FTP-server](./FTP.md) to limit the size of the website.
- A review process will pull requests is used for class material.
