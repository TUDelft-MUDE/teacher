# Interactive Online Textbooks

We make use of an interactive online textbook to share content with students.Therefore, we make use of the [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/) platform, which is a spin-off of [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).

## Viewing the book

- Material is released to students when a commit is made to the `2025` branch at [https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025)
- Prior to sharing with students, material should be reviewed by making a commit to the `2025-draft` branch. This can be viewed at [https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025-draft/](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025-draft/).
- All other branches can be viewed on GitHub. Default is that the branch name is added after the root URL/repo_name. Actions page which summarizes all the branches and status: [https://github.com/TUDelft-MUDE/book/actions](https://github.com/TUDelft-MUDE/book/actions)


## Editing the book
You can edit the book in the github repository: [https://github.com/TUDelft-MUDE/book](https://github.com/TUDelft-MUDE/book) with the following steps:
- Create a branch with your edits
- Open a draft pull request and ask for feedback
- As soon as it ready, mark the pull request as ready
- The content coordinator will merge you pull request

If you don't have access to this repository, request for it by asking Tom.

Depending on the type of user you want to be, you need to know only a few details or a bit more. Find out which user type you want to be at [https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/jupyter-book-manual/installation-and-setup/user_types.html](https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/jupyter-book-manual/installation-and-setup/user_types.html).

Specifically for this MUDE-book:
- User type 1/2: review by opening an issue by clicking the lightbulb on the top-right corner of a page
- User type 3/4/5: edit a file on a new branch and create a merge request to 2025-draft.

If you've never edited a book before, go through the relevant pages (indicated per user type per page) in the `Your first TeachBooks` part of the [TeachBooks Manual](https://teachbooks.io/manual/intro.html) first.

### A bit of history

- 2022-23: we made a Jupyter Book to archive of all material; students did not use an online book, only Brightspace
- 2023-24: we made our first Jupyter Book, which used the draft-release workflow to release material
- 2024-25: goal is to make the book open with a CC-BY license. GitHub (TeachBooks) is used to mirror the repo and facilitate a large number of draft versions of the book that can be used for review via the github actions workflow
- 2025-26: all the book stuff is moved to GitHub to ease the deployment flow.
